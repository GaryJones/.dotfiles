# .zshenv is sourced on ALL invocations of the shell, unless the -f option is
# set.  It should NOT normally contain commands to set the command search path,
# or other common environment variables unless you really know what you're
# doing.  E.g. running "PATH=/custom/path gdb program" sources this file (when
# gdb runs the program via $SHELL), so you want to be sure not to override a
# custom environment in such cases.  Note also that .zshenv should not contain
# commands that produce output or assume the shell is attached to a tty.

# Set path as only allowing unique values
typeset -U path
